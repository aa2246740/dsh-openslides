/**
 * The reference pack is mandatory reading for the design agent, so anything the
 * vendored skill text says is something the model may tell the end user. This
 * product owns the editor and the exporter, so its reference material must never
 * send a user to a shell, a local server, an external domain, or a disk path —
 * and must never promise a local toolchain it does not need.
 *
 * The scan runs over the manifest-verified chunk bytes: exactly what the model
 * reads. A desktop-era instruction re-entering the skill fails here.
